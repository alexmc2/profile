   - URL state management (nuqs) for list view filters (page, sort, search)

**Technical Implementation:**

The Discussion Forum Module leverages:

- Next.js 15 App Router with Server Components for initial loads (/page.tsx, /[id]/page.tsx)
- Client Components (discussion-list-panel.tsx, discussion-detail-panel.tsx, reply-item.tsx) for interactivity
- useApiSWR hook for client-side data fetching, revalidation, and managing cache updates after mutations
- Server Actions (/actions/discussion-forum/) for all data mutations (create, update, delete, vote, react) returning Promise<ActionResult<...>>
- TipTap editor (components/members/my-editor/forum-editor.tsx) for rich text input
- Cloudinary or Supabase Storage for handling file attachments (attachment-actions.ts)
- nuqs library for managing list view state (pagination, sorting, search) in URL query parameters
- Recursive rendering (reply-list.tsx, reply-item.tsx) to display nested reply threads based on data processed by utils/forum-utils.ts (buildReplyTree)

**Database Schema:**

The module is supported by several PostgreSQL tables within Supabase:

- `discussions`: Stores main topic details (title, content, author, poll settings)
- `discussion_replies`: Stores replies (content, author, parent reply/discussion ID)
- `discussion_votes`: Tracks up/down votes on discussions and replies
- `discussion_reactions`: Tracks emoji reactions on discussions and replies
- `discussion_polls`: Stores poll details linked to a discussion (question, start/end times)
- `discussion_poll_votes`: Tracks member votes (yes/no/abstain) on polls
- `discussion_reply_attachments`: Stores metadata about attachments linked to replies (file URL, type, size)
- RLS Policies: Row Level Security is critical to ensure users can only perform actions they are authorized for (e.g., voting once, editing own replies, respecting poll timings)

**User Experience:**

The Discussion Forum interface prioritizes:

- Clear separation between discussion topics and threaded replies
- Intuitive controls for voting, reacting, replying, and editing
- Responsive design for usability across devices
- Rich text editing experience with TipTap
- Secure and easy attachment handling
- Loading states (skeletons for initial load, subtle indicators for revalidation) and error feedback (e.g., via toasts)
- Optimistic UI updates for a snappy feel during interactions

**Integration:**

The Discussion Forum Module connects with:

- User Profiles (profiles table) for authorship, voting, and reactions attribution
- Cloud Storage (Cloudinary / Supabase Storage) for managing attachments
- Notification System (potentially) for alerting users about new replies or mentions
- Shared Components (emoji-reactions, render-tiptap-content)

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The members portal is configured as a Progressive Web App, allowing members to install it on their devices and access it offline with cached data.

## Modern Data Fetching Architecture

The application implements a modern, efficient data fetching architecture using SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) for client-side data fetching and caching. This approach combines the strengths of server-side rendering for initial page loads with client-side data fetching for dynamic updates.

### SWR Implementation

The SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) implementation provides several key benefits:

1. **Automatic Caching**

   - Client-side data caching for improved performance
   - Automatic revalidation strategies
   - Deduplication of requests to minimize network traffic
   - Stale data display while fetching fresh data

2. **Optimistic UI Updates**

   - Immediate UI feedback before server confirmation
   - Automatic rollback on errors
   - Improved perceived performance for users
   - Real-time interface updates

3. **Consistent Error Handling**

   - Standardized error response format
   - Graceful fallback to cached data on errors
   - Automatic retry on failures
   - Comprehensive error reporting to users

4. **Server-Side Initial Data**
   - Server-rendered initial state for fast page loads
   - Hydration with client-side data for dynamic updates
   - SEO-friendly content delivery
   - Reduced initial load time

### Data Fetching Pattern

The application follows a consistent data fetching pattern:

1. **Server Components** fetch initial data during server-side rendering:

   ```typescript
   // Server Component
   const initialData = await fetchInitialData(searchParams);

   return <ClientComponent initialData={initialData} />;
   ```

2. **Client Components** use SWR with the initial data as fallback:

   ```typescript
   // Client Component
   const { data, error, isLoading, mutate } = useSWR(apiUrl, fetcher, {
     fallbackData: initialData,
     revalidateOnFocus: false,
   });
   ```

3. **API Routes** provide standardized data interfaces:

   ```typescript
   // API Route
   export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
     try {
       const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams;
       const result = await getData(searchParams);
       return NextResponse.json(result);
     } catch (error) {
       return NextResponse.json(
         { success: false, error: String(error) },
         { status: 500 }
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Server Actions** handle data mutations:
   ```typescript
   // Server Action
   export async function updateData(id: string, data: DataType) {
     try {
       const result = await database.update(id, data);
       return { success: true, data: result };
     } catch (error) {
       return { success: false, error: String(error) };
     }
   }
   ```

### URL State Management

The application uses URL state management with `nuqs` for shareable state:

```typescript
// URL State Management
const [page, setPage] = useQueryState('page', {
  defaultValue: initialPage.toString(),
  parse: (value) => value,
});

const [filter, setFilter] = useQueryState('filter', {
  defaultValue: initialFilter,
  parse: (value) => value,
});
```

This approach ensures:

- Shareable URLs with complete application state
- Persistent state during navigation
- Bookmarkable filter and sort configurations
- SEO-friendly content parameters

### Modules Using SWR

The following modules have been migrated to the SWR data fetching pattern:

- Treasury Module
- Secretary Module
- Social Events Module
- Bug Reporting Module
- Feature Request Module
- Contacts Management
- Garden Module (in progress)

### Response Format Standard

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  pagination?: {
    currentPage: number;
    pageSize: number;
    totalItems: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}
```

This standardization ensures consistent error handling, pagination support, and data structure across all application features.
