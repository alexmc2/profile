Personal Statement:

I’m a graduate of the Northcoders software development course (Manchester, UK) where I developed a strong foundation in JavaScript, front-end and back-end development, and an appreciation of the importance of testing.

I'm excited to continue learning, growing and contributing to the tech industry.

Built with NextJs, I developed an AI-enhanced journaling application that assists users in tracking and reflecting on their emotional wellbeing. The app features a LangChain-powered chatbot that utilises vector embeddings to provide a contextually aware personalised chat experience, offering insights and perspectives tailored to the user's journal content and previous chat history. For more information on the development process, please visit the README section of the GitHub repository.

A simple colour palette generator built with Python. The backend, built with Flask, communicates with the OpenAI API to produce colour themes or palettes based on user prompts. The app is hosted using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CodePipeline. While straightforward, this project has been a valuable learning experience in terms of working with Python for the first time and familiarising myself with AWS deployment.
